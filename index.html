        <h1>About Albert Camus</h1>
        <p>
          Albert Camus (1913-1960) was a French-Algerian philosopher, author,
          and playwright known for his contributions to existentialism and
          absurdism, two philosophical movements that explore the human
          condition and the meaning of life. Camus was born in French Algeria
          and later moved to France, where he became associated with a group of
          writers and thinkers who explored the existentialist philosophy,
          including Jean-Paul Sartre.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite his connection to existentialism, Camus' works also exhibit
          elements of absurdism, a philosophy that suggests that the human
          search for meaning in an inherently meaningless and indifferent
          universe is ultimately futile.
